# Virtual_Assistant_Program
<p>I have attempted to create a virtual assistant capable of doing every thing that a full fledged virtual assistant program like Google Assistant or Alexa can do.</p>

Here I have used some of common libraries like;
- Webbrowser
- wikipedia
- Friday_assistant
- pyttsx3
- speech_recognition
- datetime
- ecapture
- wolframalpha
- datetime


If you like you can also contribute to this program and can make changes.
